Namaste and HI! I am KRISHNA KHADKA and  I am 20.  I am an IT student at NAMI college, perusing my academic career in Software Engineering. NAMI college is running with affiliation to University of Northampton and my UoN ID: is 22425874. 

Academically, I passed my secondary level education from NITEN MEMORIAL SCHOOL and completed my high school course INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE  DIPLOMA PROGRAMME (IBDP) from ULLENS SCHOOL with full-bright scholarship. And I took a gap year as COVID-19 pandemic started to hamper the student’s education timeline and it so did mine. However, the gap year was very useful and helpful for me as I came to recognize my passion and interests on computer science and technology. It was in the gap year I assisted NITEN MEMORIAL SCHOOL managing and running the online classes for the hostel students more efficiently. During the voluntary period I assisted the school IT department on managing the network management and home-schooling in a hostel. This is when I really felt that I want to do my undergraduate program in computer based course. And here I am doing my first assignment on developing my portfolio webpage.

Moreover, I really enjoy teaching  and I have been volunteering as a tuition tutor of grade 10 in  NITEN MEMORIAL SCHOOL in the evening maths and science. Adding on to this I also took online teaching course run by professional British teacher, Ann Preston during COVID-19 pandemic. I really felt I lost my time taking a gap year but with all the skills and personal development I went through pandemic I confidently say that it it was worthy exchange against academic time I lost in gap year.
Digging more about me I am sporty person and I really like playing soccer and cricket and I follow them very closely. I defined myself as a persevere and hard-working person. I follow a principle in my life and i.e “Hardwork beats talent if talent doesn’t work hard”. So if you work hard you get what you want. </div>
