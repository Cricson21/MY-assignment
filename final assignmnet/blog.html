	<div class="blog-left"><h1 class="heading"> Phase-1</h1>
	<p>This is the initial phase of my webpage development and it started the day my university lecture classes started. I personally name this phase as an” Incubation Phase”. As this is the phase where my skills on web development started. We were given some hints what our assignments in the module CSY1018 would be based on that we had our lecture class and tutorial classes. It was in the tutorial classes that I developed my coding skills for web development. In this phase I started to browse through different websites and  looked at the interfaces of those pages to have sight and overview of what kind of interfaces I can use for my port folio.</p>

	<div class="blog-mid"><h1 class="heading"> Phase-2</h1> <p>Lastly, as per me, the main reason for me on finishing my assignment was because I spent too much time on demo pages on W3SCHOOLS and I thought of making it too big or too professional being a beginner. Hope this BLOG will impart insights on how you can work in a better way to make a portfolio webpage</p> </div>

	<div class="blog-right"><h1 class="heading"> Phase-3</h1> On Feb-10-2022, we got notified about our assignment through NILE. Phase-2 of my proceeding portfolio web page development started from this day. I started to brain-storm and made some sample templated with place holder to see through my skills. I came to realize I was lacking some visualization ability with some tags and CSS properties. To strengthen this weakness I started to go back to my lecture slides and try them on “W3SCHOOLS” with some practice, revision and discussion with module leader and friends I had my problems with visualisation sorted out. Then I finally made my first structure of my portfolio page using sublime text editor.
