  <div class="blog-intro"> <p>Hello! welcome to my BLOG. In this section I have written about the my proceedings on making this portfolio webpage. Please don’t forget to suggest me on how I can make this page better and contact me at the same time to get some ideas as well.</p></div>

	<div class="blog-left"><h1 class="heading"> Phase-1</h1>
	<p>This is the initial phase of my webpage development and it started the day my university lecture classes started. I personally name this phase as an” Incubation Phase”. As this is the phase where my skills on web development started. We were given some hints what our assignments in the module CSY1018 would be based on that we had our lecture class and tutorial classes. It was in the tutorial classes that I developed my coding skills for web development. In this phase I started to browse through different websites and  looked at the interfaces of those pages to have sight and overview of what kind of interfaces I can use for my portfolio.</p>

	<div class="blog-mid"><h1 class="heading"> Phase-2</h1> <p>On Feb-10-2022, we got notified about our assignment through NILE. Phase-2 of my proceeding portfolio web page development started from this day. I started to brain-storm and made some sample templated with place holder to see through my skills. I came to realize I was lacking some visualization ability with some tags and CSS properties. To strengthen this weakness I started to go back to my lecture slides and try them on “W3SCHOOLS” with some practice, revision and discussion with module leader and friends I had my problems with visualisation sorted out. Then I finally made my first structure of my portfolio page using sublime text editor. </p> </div>

	<div class="blog-right"><h1 class="heading"> Phase-3</h1> <p>This is the final phase as the day of submission was near and with TCA exams and assignment submission deadline somewhat together (TCA of CSY1018 was postponed due to strike in NEPAL). I was little of the track and I had problem with the template or the structure that I developed in phase 2. I was wasn’t able to manage and display the contents and structure as the way I wanted hence with the same code and concept I started a new structure and worked on it. It wasn’t too time consuming as I anticipated. With the experience and knowledge I collected through lecture classes, W3SCHOOLS and the different layouts or demo templates that I worked on to improve my skills, I was able to finish my portfolio webpage by appropriate time. 

Lastly, as per me, the main reason for me on finishing my assignment was because I spent too much time on demo pages on W3SCHOOLS and I thought of making it too big or too professional being a beginner. Hope this BLOG will impart insights on how you can work in a better way to make a portfolio webpage  </p>
