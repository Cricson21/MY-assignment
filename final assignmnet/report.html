	 		<h4>1.ABSTRACT</h4>
	 		<p>Despite not being being a student from computer background academically, learning the basics of coding, design and web development wasn’t as complex as I anticipated. My experience and learning outcomes engaging in this web development assignment helped me understand the basic fundamentals of web development and coding skills. However, stating module CSY1018 was completely new to me but with regular lecture and tutorial classes I caught up with the module contents. Initially, the challenge that I really interacted with is the visualization and understanding of the codes, tags and CSS properties while starting but with regular lecture activities and tutorial in W3SCHOOL helped me a lot to understand the working mechanism and fundamental of HTML and CSS. Now, I am really confident and delighted to have this skill developed through the module CSY1018.</p>
	 		<h4>2.MODULE OVERVIEW</h4>
	 		<p>Thus far, as per my experience, module CSY1018 has a complete package of the basic knowledge that an individual can acquire to start working on web development.  Moreover, the module leader, Mr. Ankit Thapa, is very helpful and full of experience to guide learner through the academic journey. I am very satisfied with the module leader and with his assistance on doubt clearance academically.</p>
	 		<h4>3.DESIGN DECISIONS AND IDEAS</h4>
	 		<p> Talking about the design decision, I went through the multiple websites for ideas and came up with an idea on how to place my portfolio contents. Influencing webpages that I visited are:
            <ol>
     			<li>daraz </li>
    			<li>w3schools</li>
       			<li>nile.northampton.ac.uk</li>
       		</ol>
           <p> But another challenge and that I face was the grid that I developed for my webpage which had box overlapping two grids but while manipulating the screen size I wasn’t able to understand the gap’s content movements. Then I changed my mind and took new design decision. For this new layout as well I used grid layouts.  And I was influenced to this page outlook from the webpage “Code Academy”  upper part which is navigation bar and logo as I placed my contents like in theirs. And then to generate navigation bar I took idea from module lecture slide and YouTube video.
           Moreover, I also made a new github repository as I wanted to place my assignment apart from my other clasroom assignments. Then I moved all of my files from my old repository to new one. Regarding hamburger icon I tried to avoid the plgarism and decided not to make it as I was afraid of the scripts and universal code that could turn out to be plagarized. However, in order to avoid the problem while opening this webpage in different devices with small screen dimension I have sized my navigation bar in such a way it doesn't maniulate anyother element except it's own place. Making the page responsive I have changed the column contents to row in order to make it easier for viewer to read through contents while opening the page from mobiles or small screened devices.

           <h4>4.CONCLUSION</h4>

            </p>
            Then finally working out with all the references that I took to facilitate my page outlook and design. I finished my portfolio webpage. This was a challenging as well as very practical and resourceful assignment that could make our web development skills better. After finishing this assignmwnt I have learnt alot about the fundamentals of the web development and I am looking forward learn more and execute the knowledge in the coming assignmnet.
