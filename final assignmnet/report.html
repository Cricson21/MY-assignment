	 		<p>Despite not being being a student from computer background academically, learning the basics of coding, design and web development wasn’t as complex as I anticipated. My experience and learning outcomes engaging in this web development assignment helped me understand the basic fundamentals of web development and coding skills. However, stating module CSY1018 was completely new to me but with regular lecture and tutorial classes I caught up with the module contents. Initially, the challenge that I really interacted with is the visualization and understanding of the codes, tags and CSS properties while starting but with regular lecture activities and tutorial in W3SCHOOL helped me a lot to understand the working mechanism and fundamental of HTML and CSS. Now, I am really confident and delighted to have this skill developed through the module CSY1018.</p>
	 		<p>Thus far, as per my experience, module CSY1018 has a complete package of the basic knowledge that an individual can acquire to start working on web development.  Moreover, the module leader, Mr. Ankit Thapa, is very helpful and full of experience to guide learner through the academic journey. I am very satisfied with the module leader and with his assistance on doubt clearance academically.</p>
	 		<p> Talking about the design decision, I went through the multiple websites for ideas and came up with an idea on how to place my portfolio contents. Influencing webpages that I visited are:
            <ol>
     			<li>daraz </li>
    			<li>w3schools</li>
       			<li>nile.northampton.ac.uk</li>
       		</ol>
           <p> But another challenge and that I face was the grid that I developed for my webpage which had box overlapping two grids but while manipulating the screen size I wasn’t able to understand the gap’s content movements. Then I changed my mind and took new design decision. For this new layout as well I used grid layouts.  An I was influenced to this page outlook from the webpage “Code Academy”  upper part which is navigation bar and logo. And then to generate navigation bar I took idea from module lecture slide and YouTube video. 
            </p>
            Then finally working out with all the references that I took to facilitate my page outlook and design. I finished my portfolio webpage.
